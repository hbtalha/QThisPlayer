# QThisPlayer
A media player written in Qt C++ using libvlc. Created for personal use to help me watch video tutorials better.

# Motivation
When I am starting to learn a new technology I always start by watching video tutorials I find on YouTube. Recently I have been watching more and more one video long (3 - 6 hours) course videos instead of single videos in a playlist.


And since YouTube added the chapters feature I had been wanting something similar in a media player where I would just drag and drop the timestamps found in the video description and it would just add chapters to my video mimicing the YouTube player.


And another feature that I had been longing in a video player for a long time is the picture in picture mode. Vlc has the 'Always on top' feature that you can make a picture in picture video out of it but it's just unpractical for me to be resizing the window all the time.

So I implemented the two features described above in the QThisPlayer. Besides those two, I implemented only the features I use the most in VLC.

# Built with
